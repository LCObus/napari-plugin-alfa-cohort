## Overview

The Alfa Cohort is a collaboration among 8 premier Python-based segmentation tool developers and the CZI Imaging Team in support of the napari project.
We seek to establish some of the first analysis plugins for the open source [napari](https://napari.org), ensure that the platform meets the needs of these tools and their users, and work together to make napari the best place to build and share image analysis methods.
