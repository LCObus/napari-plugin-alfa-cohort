## Overview

The Alfa Cohort is a collaboration among 8 leading Python-based image analysis tool developers and the CZI Imaging Team in support of the napari project. Focusing on detection and segmentation of cells, nuclei, and structures, we seek to (1) establish some of the first analysis plugins for the open source [napari](https://napari.org), (2) ensure that the platform meets the needs of these tools and their users, and (3) work together to make napari the best place to build and share image analysis methods.
