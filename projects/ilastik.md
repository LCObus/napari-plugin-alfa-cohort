## Purpose

> Describe the problem you are trying to solve by packaging your tool as a napari plugin in 1-2 sentences.
I should be able to read this alone and communicate the value to someone else.

### Why does this matter to biologists?

### Why does this matter to you and your professional goals and responsibilities?

## Goals
> What would you like to accomplish during the Alfa Cohort collaboration?

1. Offer “bread and butter” classic Ilastik pixel-based classifier application as a napari plugin
2. Evaluate napari’s opportunity to support other tools that the Ilastik group is developing

### Non-goals
> Are there any possible goals that are explicitly out of scope for the Alfa Cohort?

1. Do not want to replace support for “classic” Ilastik

## Scope

### Key Flows

> Show what the end-to-end experience will be for biologists.

A biologist will be able to
1. Load data
2. Select filters to compute and use as features
3. Interactively label
4. Evaluate results
5. Predict everything
6. Export
7. Save project to be used in batch mode
